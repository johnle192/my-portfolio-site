        Hi there, I'm John and this is my website. I'm a self-taught developer
        currently based out of the DFW area. I was born and raised in Wisconsin
        and went to college at Northwestern University. In my spare time, I like
        to rock climb, lift, dance, bake, and play with my dog, Danny.
